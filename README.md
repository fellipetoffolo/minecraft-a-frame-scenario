### Minecraft a-frame scenario

This small project aims to show how the a-frame tool can be used to generate minecraft-like scenarios.

There is not a big variety of blocks, neither code optimization, but it may serve as a starting point/example of what can be done to achieve the goal of making a more complex minecraft scenario acessible by the browser.
